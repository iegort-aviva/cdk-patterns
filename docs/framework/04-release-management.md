There are tree approaches can be used

[TBD]

## 1. General Release for Whole Repository

### **Pros**: 

- **Simplicity**: Easier to manage with a single release process and versioning system for all constructs, reducing operational complexity. 

- **Consistency**: Ensures that all constructs in the repository are always at the same version, simplifying dependency management for users. 

- **Streamlined Process**: Facilitates a straightforward CI/CD pipeline setup, as thereâ€™s only one pipeline to configure for releases.


###**Cons**: 

- **Limited Flexibility**: Changes in any single construct necessitate a new release for the entire repository, which may not be ideal for minor updates. 

- **Potential for Unnecessary Updates**: Consumers may need to update their dependencies more frequently, even for constructs they use that haven't changed. 

- **Broader Impact of Changes**: A bug or a breaking change in one construct affects the versioning of all constructs, potentially impacting a wider range of users.

## 2. Monorepo with Separate Releases for `default` and `patterns`

### **Pros**:

- **Balanced Flexibility and Manageability**: Allows for more targeted releases while maintaining the simplicity of managing a unified repository.

- **Layer-Specific Versioning**: Enables versioning that reflects the maturity and stability of constructs within each layer, offering more precise control over updates and dependencies.

- **Efficient Dependency Management for Consumers**: Users can update constructs based on the specific layers they utilize, avoiding unnecessary updates for unaffected constructs.

### **Cons**:

- **Increased Management Complexity**: Requires managing two separate release processes, versioning systems, and potentially CI/CD pipelines within the same repository.

- **Risk of Dependency Conflicts**: There might be challenges in managing cross-dependencies between constructs in the default and patterns folders, especially if they evolve at different rates.

- **Potential for Confusion**: Users must understand the structure and the distinction between the two layers, which may introduce a learning curve.

## 3. Separate Release Per Construct

### **Pros**:

- **Maximum Flexibility**: Each construct can be versioned and released independently, allowing for precise control over changes and updates.

- **Reduced Impact of Changes**: Changes, including bug fixes and features, are isolated to individual constructs, minimizing the risk to other constructs.

- **Targeted Updates for Consumers**: Users can update only the constructs they use, without being forced to adapt to changes in unrelated constructs.

### **Cons**:

- **High Operational Complexity**: Managing separate release processes, versioning, and CI/CD pipelines for each construct significantly increases operational complexity.

- **Version Fragmentation**: With each construct evolving independently, there could be a wide range of versions in use at any one time, complicating support and compatibility efforts.
  
- **Increased Overhead for Dependency Management**: Both maintainers and users may face challenges in managing dependencies, especially when dealing with interdependencies between constructs in larger projects.
